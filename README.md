# Welcome aboard, friend!

This repository contains the information that is most important to me in my work: QA, aQA, Java, etc.

I use Obsidian app for editing this knowledge base and inner links can not work on GitHub. If you want to help me in this hard work â€” you're welcome! I'll write rules to help me make sure the place is clear when someone joins me.

I'll give more details here later, maybe...

P.S. Almost all information here will be in Russian. As I learn English, I will try to increase the volume of English-language notes.
